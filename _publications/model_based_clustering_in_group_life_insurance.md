Abstract: Experience rating allows insurance companies to adjust the premium for a certain policyholder on the basis of the loss experienced by similar insured parties. In group life insurance, because of the lack of complete information, clustering policyholders is particularly challenging. To address this issue we adopt a model-based clustering approach using flexible Bayesian nonparametric mixtures, which take into account the discrete nature of data, consisting of claim counts. We consider a Pitman-Yor mixture of Rounded Gaussian kernels, which provides more flexible and robust results than standard Poisson mixtures. We show how this approach leads to more accurate inference compared to standard Dirichlet process mixtures of Poisson, through an application to data arising from a portfolio of groups of workers.
